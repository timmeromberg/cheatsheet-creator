# Shortcut Cheatsheet Creator

This application allows you to create your own custom keyboard cheat sheet.
Each key on the keyboard can be assigned a specific action, as well as combinations of that key with certain modifier keys (such as Shift).
The assigned actions are displayed on the keyboard layout, which can be used for quick reference.
Additionally, a downloadable PNG is available for offline use or printing (which is the primary purpose).
The inputted actions are stored using local storage, and a backup can be created or restored with the Save/Load Cheat Sheet functions.

This tool serves as a marketing tool for a Video Game Art Design Studio called "High Priority".
